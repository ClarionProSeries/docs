# Developer Mode

**Developer Mode** changes how ProPath behaves to simplify testing and debugging during development.

It makes it easy to test your application with alternate data folders without recompiling or changing template settings.

You can also use it to troubleshoot customer data without the need to recompile the program to use a new path or move data files to alternate locations.

Developer Mode can be controlled by:
- **Fixed data paths** defined in the template for consistent local testing  
- **External INI file** for runtime flexibility and quick path switching

HINT: You can leave developer mode enabled all the time if you are using the External INI file method.  

**Just don't ship the INI file!**

ProPath Developer Mode is a valuable tool that saves time by letting you adjust paths and test data locations without reopening the template.
