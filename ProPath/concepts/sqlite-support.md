# SQLite Support

ProPath adds full support for **SQLite** databases in both single and multi-dataset configurations.  

---

## Key Features

- Automatic creation and management of `.db` files in Main or System paths  
- Seamless switching between datasets that use different SQLite databases  
- Integrated path handling for compact, self-contained application deployment  
- Compatible with Firebird and other SQL driver setups, allowing side-by-side use  

Developers can use the ProPath template to configure dataset-specific SQLite locations for development, testing, or production builds.

---

## Driver Compatibility

ProPath is also compatible with the **SQLite2** driver from **CapeSoft's File Driver Kit** (and the upcoming Firebird2 driver).
