# Clarion ProPath - Template Registration

When you run the installer, it will offer to automatically register the template during the installation process.  

If you decide not to allow that, or if you need to re-register the template at a later time, follow these steps:

1. In the Clarion IDE, click **Tools** > **Edit Template Registry**.
2. In the **Template Registry** window, click **Register**.
3. In the file picker, navigate to:  
   `C:\ClarionXX\accessory\template\win\`
4. Select **PS_ProPathABC.tpl** and click **Open**.
5. Confirm that **PS_ProPathABC** appears in the list of registered templates and click **OK**.

**Note:** If you install or upgrade to a new version of Clarion, you may need to re-register **ProPath** in that version.
