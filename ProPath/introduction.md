# ProPath - Introduction

**ProPath** is path management for Clarion.

It gives you complete control over where your data files, INI files, and support files are stored on the end user's computer.  

No more guessing or hoping that Windows will not redirect your data or settings to a "safe" location and break your software in the process.

ProPath helps you ensure that all files are stored in proper Windows standard locations and that they remain accessible to the correct user account even when elevation or virtualization are involved.
