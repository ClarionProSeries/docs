## Clarion ProPath Demo 25 - Overview

This demo shows how Clarion ProPath integrates with an **embedded Firebird database**, managing both the file paths and connection strings automatically.

### Key Features

- All required Firebird embedded client files are placed in the application folder  
- ProPath dynamically defines and maintains the Firebird database path  
- Database and INI files are automatically created on first run if missing  
- Connection string uses the **PROPATH:** token so ProPath controls all path resolution  
- Supports automatic creation of missing database files  
- Includes an **Explore** template option to open the Firebird data folder in Windows Explorer
