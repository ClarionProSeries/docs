## 1.4 — 2025-11-6

- Converted legacy Help & Manual content to ProHelp Studio Markdown.
- Added root level Version History page and updated breadcrumbs sitewide.

## 1.2 — 2025-07-02

- Added full XML entity encoding support in request generation via `QBXMLTools.EncodeXML`.
- Added automatic XML decoding in `ValidateResponse` and field extraction methods using `QBXMLTools.DecodeXML`.
- Fixed issue with extra whitespace being introduced after tag values in generated request XML.
- Improved tag formatting and indentation across all `RequestAddTag`, `RequestOpenTag`, and `RequestCloseTag` methods.
- Added automatic session management: `ProcessRequest` now internally calls `BeginSession` and `EndSession` if no active session is present.
- Added automatic connection handling: `ProcessRequest` opens a QuickBooks connection if not already open.
- Implemented automatic tag closure: if `RequestClose` is not explicitly called, it will be invoked automatically by `ProcessRequest`.
- Developers using the wrapper without the Clarion template no longer need to manually handle session or tag closure logic for standard request flows.
- Updated the “Hand Coded Applications” section to include actual code generated by the template for startup and shutdown.

## 1.1 — 2025-06-12

- First general public release.
