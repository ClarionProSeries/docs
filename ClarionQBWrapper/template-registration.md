# Clarion QuickBooks Wrapper - Template Registration

If you chose not to let the installer register the template automatically, or you need to re-register it later, follow these steps in the Clarion IDE:

1. Open **Tools** → **Edit Template Registry**.  
2. In the **Template Registry** window, click **Register**.  
3. In the file picker, browse to your Clarion accessory templates folder:  
   `C:\ClarionXX\accessory\template\win`  
4. Select **PS_ProSeriesQBWrapper.tpl** and click **Open**.  
5. Confirm that **PS_ProSeriesQBWrapper** appears in the installed template list and click **OK** to close.

**Notes**

- Repeat these steps for each Clarion version you have installed.  
- After installing or upgrading to a new Clarion version, you may need to re-register the template in that version.
