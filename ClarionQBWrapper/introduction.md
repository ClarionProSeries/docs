# Clarion QuickBooks Wrapper - Introduction

**Clarion QuickBooks Wrapper** is a Clarion class and template set that makes it straightforward to connect your application to QuickBooks Desktop with QBXML.

## What it does

- Makes it easy to build and send QBXML requests from Clarion.  
- Automatically parses QBXML responses so you can access returned data directly.  
- Removes the need to hand craft XML formatting.  
- Ships with Markdown documentation that works on the web and in CHM builds.

## New in Version 1.4: QBAI - Let AI do the work for you!

Version 1.4 introduces **QBAI**, a high level class that wraps the core QuickBooks wrapper classes.

- **AI primer workflow**: Give the QBAI primer to your preferred AI and ask for Clarion code that performs the QuickBooks task you need.  
- **Higher level calls**: Use QBAI to avoid the low level QBXML details for common operations.  
- **Code checker console**: Test queries and requests in real time before you commit them to your application.  

This approach sets Clarion QuickBooks Wrapper apart from earlier versions and from other Clarion wrappers for QuickBooks by enabling faster, more repeatable development with AI assistance.
