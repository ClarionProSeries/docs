# About ProHelp Studio

ProHelp Studio is our next-generation help authoring and publishing system.  
It is built around Markdown, designed for developers who want simple, portable documentation without the complexity of legacy CHM workflows.

### Highlights

- Author in plain Markdown  
- Publish help for both web and desktop use  
- Built-in search, categories, and versioning  
- A migration path away from CHM to a future-proof format  
- Produce professional-quality documentation with no need to learn HTML or CSS  

ProHelp Studio is currently in development. This documentation set for vuFileTools was created with a similar Markdown-first approach and will be directly compatible with ProHelp Studio.
