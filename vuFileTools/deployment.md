# Deployment and Usage

vuFileTools includes a small DLL that performs all the API operations for you.

## Deployment

You must deploy **vuFT5.dll** with your application.

## Usage

Note: Most functions require parameters. You must create and use the proper data elements for each function. Although you can use a number directly in a function (where appropriate), you cannot use a literal string. Instead, assign the string value to a CSTRING variable and call the function with that variable.

Each function section in this documentation shows the calling prototype, the type of data expected as a parameter (if any), and the return value data type (if any).

Sample usage from Clarion is also provided.

The example applications included demonstrate practical use of the functions. Reviewing these examples often provides better context for understanding how the functions are used in real programs.
