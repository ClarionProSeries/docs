# vuFileTools - Support

If you need support with vuFileTools please contact us at:   

<a href="http://clarionproseries.com/html/contact.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
http://clarionproseries.com/html/contact.php
</a>

Include the template name, template version, and your purchase/contact information as well as the OS version and version of Clarion that you are using.

**Note:** We answer all contacts promptly and our web form makes sure that your messages are never lost in a spam filter.  

If more than 24 hours goes by and you have not heard back from us, it is very possible that your ISP is blocking our emails to you.

If you suspect this is the case, please contact us again using another email address (such as a Gmail address).  

Also keep an eye on the Third Party Newsgroup to see if we are pinging your name there (which we will do if our emails to you are being returned to us).
