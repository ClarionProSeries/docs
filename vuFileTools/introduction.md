# vuFileTools - Introduction

**vuFileTools** is a developer library containing over 200 ready-to-use Windows API functions, designed to simplify programming in Clarion and other environments. The functions cover a wide range of tasks such as working with files and folders, compression, version information, network status, shortcuts, and more.

Instead of writing complex Windows API calls yourself, you can rely on vuFileTools to provide consistent, Clarion-friendly wrappers. Each function has been tested, documented, and comes with working Clarion code examples.

## Version 5 Highlights

- No limitations on the size of C-strings that can be used with functions.

- Every function fully documented with code examples ready to copy and use.
