# Installation

When you run the installer for vuFileTools it will attempt to find valid Clarion installations on your computer and let you choose which one to install the template for.

You can run the installer multiple times and install to multiple versions of Clarion without any problem. The installer will set up separate folders, links to help files, and installed files as needed.

You can update or remove one version of vuFileTools without affecting any other installed copy.

## Installed File Locations

By default, the installers follow the standards and guidelines for Clarion third-party developers.

#### Working Files
The working files are installed into the appropriate subfolders of the **root accessory** folder beneath your **base** Clarion installation folder.  

For example:

C:\Clarion12 *(the base folder)*  
C:\Clarion12\accessory *(the root folder for accessory files)*  
C:\Clarion12\accessory\bin  

- **vuFT5.dll**  

C:\Clarion12\accessory\lib  

- **vuFT5.lib**  

C:\Clarion12\accessory\template\win  

- **vuFileTools.tpl**  

C:\Clarion12\accessory\Documents\LANSRAD\vuFileTools  

- **vuFileTools.chm**  

#### Example Files

The example files are installed into the appropriate subfolders of the standard Clarion examples location.

This location is in the **Users\Public\SoftVelocity** folder so that it is available to any user profile on the installation computer.

For example:

C:\Users\Public\Documents\SoftVelocity\Clarion12 *(the Clarion version base folder)*  
C:\Users\Public\Documents\SoftVelocity\Clarion12\accessory *(the accessory base folder)*  

- **vuFileTools** *(a shortcut link to quickly access the product examples)*

C:\Users\Public\Documents\SoftVelocity\Clarion12\accessory\LANSRAD *(the vendor folder)*  
C:\Users\Public\Documents\SoftVelocity\Clarion12\accessory\LANSRAD\vuFileTools *(the product folder)*  

- **vuFileToolsDemos.html** *(notes about the demo programs)*  
- **Demo Folders** *(such as SingleExe or Multi-DLL)*  

Each demo folder contains the files relevant to that demo application.
